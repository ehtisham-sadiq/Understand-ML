# Understand-ML
This repository provides a series of tutorials designed to help you understand core machine learning concepts from scratch.

## Target Audience:

This is ideal for beginners with no prior machine learning experience or those seeking a clear and intuitive introduction to the fundamentals.

## Learning Approach:

- **Conceptual Explanations:** Each tutorial provides clear explanations of the underlying concepts behind each machine learning algorithm.
- **Hands-on Tutorials:** Jupyter notebooks guide you through practical implementations of the algorithms in Python.
- **No Magic Approach:** We break down complex topics into simpler building blocks, avoiding overwhelming jargon.

## Current Tutorials:

- **Part 0: Introduction and Notation:** (Introduction to machine learning concepts and mathematical notation)
- **Part 1: Logistic Regression:** (Understanding linear regression and its limitations, introduction to logistic regression)
- **Part 2: Softmax Regression:** (Extending logistic regression for multi-class classification problems)
- **Part 3: Building a Simple Neural Network:** (Introduction to artificial neural networks and building a basic neural network from scratch)
- **Part 4: Convolutional Neural Networks:** (Understanding convolutional layers and their applications in image processing)

## Future Tutorials (Planned):
- More advanced neural network architectures (e.g., Recurrent Neural Networks)
- Deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Unsupervised learning algorithms (e.g., K-Means clustering)
- Model evaluation and optimization techniques
